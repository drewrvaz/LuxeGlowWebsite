    <h3>Questions about spray tanning? We've got you covered!</h3>

    <h6>What should I wear during my spray tan?</h6>
    <p>During the application process, I recommend wearing whatever makes you feel comfortable - it could be a swimsuit, underwear and no bra, or your bathing suit. It does not matter to us. We do provide disposable underwear if you would prefer or aren't sure what you want to wear.</p>

    <h6>What should I wear after my spray tan?</h6>
    <p>After your spray tan, it woudl be best to wear baggy, dark clothing. This helps to avoid rubbing your spray tan on clothes or furntiture. If you have to wear shoes - be sure to wear slides.</p>

    <h6>How long will my spray tan last?</h6>
    <p>Spray tans vary from person to person, but most last between 5-10 days.</p>

    <h6>How do I care for my spray tan to ensure the longest wear?</h6>
    <p>After getting a spray tan, it is important to keep your skin hydrated and moisturized to ensure the color will last and fade evenly. Stay away from chlorine or other harsh chemicals as they can fade your spray tan. Also be mindful of shaving and exfoliating, these will increase cell turnover and cause your spray tan to fade faster.</p>

    <h6>What do I expect initially after my spray tan?</h6>
    <p>During the development period of your spray tan, generally the first 12-24 hours, the most important thing is to avoid water! Wash only the palms of your hands, be mindful of crossing your legs, crossing your arms, scratching face, etc... Any of these can cause your spray tan to become uneven. Once you wake up and take a shower, your spray tan is “set” and you can do things as normal. Do not be alarmed if you look darker than your desired color. It is sitting underneath a bronzer causing it to appear darker than it will be after you take a shower.</p>

    <h6>Will I look orange?</h6>
    <p>No! Spray tan solutions have come a long way over the years. We use a professional solutions that is created with  VIO-7, a unique blend of anti-orange bronzer pigmets designed to counter an unwanted orange undertone for a natural-looking tan.</p>

    <h6>What if I am pale? I do not want to look too dark!</h6>
    <p>We offer a variety of colors to choose from, all ranging in different final color results. We will discuss what color you are looking to achieve and make sure we suggest the best formula for you!</p>
